              <p>Hi there, I'm Dave, a creative professional with a passion for technology and design. As a software engineer, I'm constantly seeking out new and innovative ways to approach complex problems and create streamlined solutions. But my interests don't stop there - as a cinematography enthusiast, I love capturing the beauty of the world around me through the lens of my camera. Through my blog, I share my reflections on my journey as a software engineer, offer insights into my latest projects, and explore the intersection of technology and creativity. And on my podcast, The Interstice, I dive deeper into the worlds of software engineering and cinematography, sharing trends, insights, and practical advice for anyone looking to break into these exciting industries.
